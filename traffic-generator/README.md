# Traffic Generator #
The Traffic Generator is copied from the [Kiali Test Mesh Traffic Generator](https://github.com/kiali/kiali-test-mesh/) 
The Kiali team was considering retiring that code, so we moved it here.

## Introduction
The Traffic Generator uses [Vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta), a lightweight golang traffic generator.

# Building the Docker Image
Building the Test Mesh Traffic Generator requires *make* and *docker*

TODO - what repo should this go in?
